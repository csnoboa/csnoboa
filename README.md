I've already built some applications that can be useful:

- [csnoboa/battery_monitor](https://github.com/csnoboa/battery_monitor) - Be kind to your notebook battery! This project notifies you when you need to plug in or unplug the charger for battery life.
 
- [csnoboa/contador_de_jogos](https://github.com/csnoboa/contador_de_jogos) - A utility belt for board games or cards. With this Android app you can count the score of each player or team. Sort the team. Roll one dice or more. With a stopwatch so that no one takes longer than they should.
