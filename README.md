I've already built some applications that can be useful:
 
- [csnoboa/testview](https://github.com/csnoboa/testview) - Prioritize your project tests! With this project, you map your git repository and with each new commit it tells you which feature should be tested first.
 
- [csnoboa/battery_monitor](https://github.com/csnoboa/battery_monitor) - Be kind to your notebook battery! This project notifies you when you need to plug in or unplug the charger for battery life.
 
- [csnoboa/contador_de_jogos](https://github.com/csnoboa/contador_de_jogos) - A utility belt for board games or cards! With this Android app you can count the score of each player or team. Sort the team. Roll one dice or more. With a stopwatch so that no one takes longer than they should.
 
- [csnoboa/alter_file_name](https://github.com/csnoboa/alter_file_name) - Change the name of more than one file at the same time in Windows with a shortcut on the right mouse button!
